function Convert-SecureStringToString

    .SYNOPSIS
    Converts a secure string into a plain text string.

    .DESCRIPTION
    Sometimes you just need to convert a secure string into a plain text string.  This function does it for you.  Yay!  Once you do, however, the cat is out of the bag and your password will be *all over memory* and, perhaps, the file system.

    .OUTPUTS
    System.String.

    .EXAMPLE
    Convert-SecureStringToString -SecureString $mySuperSecretPasswordIAmAboutToExposeToEveryone

    Returns the plain text/decrypted value of the secure string.
    #>
    param(
        [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
        [Security.SecureString]
        # The secure string to convert.
        $SecureString
    )
    
    $stringPtr = [Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::SecureStringToBSTR($SecureString)
    return [Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::PtrToStringAuto($stringPtr)
}
